## Motivation
University life is hectic. We are constantly bombarded with one deadline after another, from homework or project submissions to competitions or club events. 
Manually keeping track of all these deadlines can be a gruelling task, and there’s no telling when you might forget about one of them entirely. 
With Calendra, you can be at ease knowing a community of your peers are here to remind you of every event. One tap will add a peer-suggested event to your calendar, 
and you can vote on each event to verify their authenticity, just like social media!

## Aim
We wish to make an app where students can quickly and conveniently add peer-suggested events and deadlines to their personal calendar, 
as well as vote on each event to verify them.

## User stories
* As a student, I want to be able to see all events and deadlines suggested by my peers, and add each one to my calendar easily. 
I also want to be reminded of these events before they come according to my own configurations. 
Moreover, I want to be able to post new events, and vote on existing events to verify them.
* As a teacher or event organiser, I want to be able to post events and deadlines where my students or audience group can see them 
and conveniently add them to their own calendars.
* As a moderator of a group, I need to be able to see all members and ban anyone I suspect might be spamming or a bot

## Scope of project
1. Key features:
   1. Upvote/Downvote system: To allow crowd verification of the legitimacy of the event.
   2. Visible/Ignore: To allow personalization since not all events in the group are relevant to all members.
   3. Star + Darker blue: Highlight the more important events
   4. Groups system: Follow relevant groups to see events posted there
   5. Personal calendar: see all events picked on a calendar, and configure notifications to one’s liking
2. Additional features:
   1. Anti-spam/anti-abuse system: Each group may have a few mods to regulate posts and also to accept followers. 
   To follow a group, users will have to wait until a mod accepts their request to follow.
   2. Login via NUS: To ensure that each student/teacher/staff only has one official account.
   3. Multi-language support

## Comparison with Existing Apps
*Default Calendar app:* with *default Calendar apps*, we have to keep track of all events and deadlines and manually add them to the calendar ourselves 
instead of using events suggested by others. This process is inefficient and tedious for a large number of deadlines and events on a regular basis.

*Google Calendar:* *Google Calendar* is designed mainly to facilitate small groups, and uses a shared calendar to show events for that group. 
*Calendra*, in contrast, can work for groups of all sizes, such as university module group or club group, since it uses a personal calendar which 
we personally populate with posted events. Moreover, we cannot vote on events in *Google Calendar*, which makes our app less susceptible to 
malicious parties such as spammers or trolls (which are admittedly more common in larger groups).
